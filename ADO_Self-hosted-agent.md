**To push an image to an Azure Container Registry (ACR) with a private end point using a Microsoft-hosted agent in Azure DevOps, you can follow these steps**:

1. Create a new Azure Container Registry or use an existing one.
2. In your Azure DevOps project, go to the Pipelines section and create a new pipeline.
3. Select the appropriate repository and branch for your source code.
4. Select the "Docker" template for your pipeline.
5. In the "Build an image" task, specify the Dockerfile path and image name that you want to build.
6. In the "Push an image" task, select the ACR registry that you created in step 1 and provide the appropriate ACR connection details.
7. For private endpoints, ensure that the ACR registry is in the same virtual network as your Azure DevOps agent. If the ACR registry is not in the same virtual network, you can set up a VNet peering between the virtual network where your ACR registry is and the virtual network where your Azure DevOps agent is running.
8. Save and run the pipeline to build and push the Docker image to your ACR registry.
9. Verify that the image has been successfully pushed to the ACR registry.

   To configure an Azure DevOps agent on your virtual network (VNet), you can follow these steps:


   1. Create a new virtual network in Azure or use an existing one.
   2. In the Azure DevOps project, go to the Agents section and select the "New agent" button.
   3. Provide a name for your agent and select "Windows" as the operating system.
   4. Download the agent and extract the contents to a directory on your machine.
   5. On the machine where the agent is installed, open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window with administrator privileges.
   6. Change the directory to the location where the agent was extracted.
   7. Run the following command to configure the agent:

   <pre><div class="bg-black mb-4 rounded-md"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans"><span class="">lua</span><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-lua">.\config.cmd
   </code></div></div></pre>

   8. When prompted, provide the URL of your Azure DevOps organization and the Personal Access Token (PAT) for the agent.
   9. When prompted, select the pool that you want to use for this agent. If you don't have an existing pool, create a new one.
   10. When prompted, select the "Advanced" option and enter the appropriate values for the VSTS_AGENT_AZURE_VNET and VSTS_AGENT_AZURE_SUBNET environment variables. The VSTS_AGENT_AZURE_VNET variable should be set to the name of your virtual network, and the VSTS_AGENT_AZURE_SUBNET variable should be set to the name of the subnet that you want to use for the agent.
   11. Run the following command to start the agent:

   <pre><div class="bg-black mb-4 rounded-md"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs">.\run.cmd
   </code></div></div></pre>

   12. Verify that the agent is connected to your Azure DevOps organization and is available in the pool.

   Note: You may need to configure the appropriate network security group (NSG) rules and/or virtual network peering to allow communication between your Azure DevOps organization and the virtual network where the agent is running.
